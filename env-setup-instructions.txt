# Environment Variables Setup Instructions

Create a file named '.env.local' in this directory with the following content:

```
# Supabase configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Case sensitivity settings (to prevent issues on Windows)
NEXT_IGNORE_INCORRECT_CASE_IN_IMPORTS=true
NODE_PATH=.
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials.
If you don't have these credentials, you can get them from your Supabase project dashboard.
